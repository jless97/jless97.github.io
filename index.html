          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
          My name is Jason Less, and I am currently a third-year Computer Science student at UCLA. I was born and raised in the Bay Area, and attended Armijo High School, where I graduated as Valedictorian of my class. I like to maintain balance in my life between academics, athletics, and through various hobbies. I have played sports my entire life such as competitive division 1 soccer, baseball, basketball, tennis, and karate. I still enjoy playing soccer here at UCLA, where I have played on competitive intramural futsal and outdoor soccer teams. In terms of hobbies, I enjoy playing video games, the piano, solving various sized Rubix cubes (3x3 to 7x7), and maintaining and expanding my Nintendo video games collection. 
          </p>
          <p>
          I wasn't sure what I wanted to major in throughout high school, but knew that I wanted to pursue a career in the math or science-related fields. I decided to choose computer science, and couldn't be happier with my decision. Technology and computers are such powerful mediums for creating incredible ideas and products that can shape society for the better, and provide exciting means of entertainment and enjoyment to the masses. I am glad to be a part of this field, and hope to make my mark on technology in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
          There are so many facets of the computer science industry that I would like to explore. I have always had an interest and passion for video games, and would like to someday work on an exciting game for a respected company. I have played around with FPGAs, embedded systems, and virtual machines and have started to recreate some of the classic arcade games such as Space Invaders. Another interest of mine is in the aerospace industry, where I was fortunate to get to work with embedded system programming to write flight software for a satellite through the UCLA ELFIN project. I am interested in so much more, and hope to solidify what path I want to follow through my UCLA coursework, outside project, and future internships.

          <p>Through my time at UCLA, I have been incredibly fortunate to have received some amazing opportunites to get hands-on experience applying the knowledge and skills I learned in the classroom to real-world applications. This last year at UCLA, I was able to work closely on a real-time space mission through a NASA-funded CubeSat satellite mission known as the Electron Losses and Fields Investigation (ELFIN) Satellite. Working full-time in a lab, I got to work directly with the satellite, communicate with upper-management and industry professionals, and participate in the various stages of satellite development and testing. This summer, I will be interning as a software engineer at Northrop Grumman Corporation's Aerospace HQ in Redondo Beach, CA, which I am very much looking forward to.</p>

                <p>The Boat in the bottle was my very first illustration 
                and really pushed me into the space of illustration. Unique to my later designs, it focuses
                more on gradients and less on flat design. I really wanted to encapsulate a new feeling to the
                idea of designing a boat, wherein the design could remain simple but be unique to just the generic boat in a sea.</p>

                <p> Continuing from my design of the boat I felt like the style of using gradients was really working.
                This inspired me to create a small token of rememberance to a great fighter and a great man in general. <a href="http://muhammadali.com/" target="_blank">Muhammad Ali</a>.
                This piece really challenged me to using the vector tool more than ever before. The aesthetic is not as pleasing
                as the other designs, but stands out to me because it was the tipping point for me to focus on simpler designs, rather
                than approach a complex piece from a simplistic style.</p>

                Instead of detailing the landscape, I wanted to try to go for a more simplistic approach, and focused on the beautiful colours of the mountains
                from all the pictures I could find. As you can see, though there is still a presence of a gradient based design, this piece showcases a focus on
                a limited colour palette in an attempt to move to a more flat look.</p>

                yet beautiful moon. To this date, I continue to believe that this was one of my best pieces as it truly showcases how a simple design
                can remain beautiful and compelling.</p>

                <p> After a sparse design with the desk, I decided to focus on a smaller object. Playing cards have always been portrayed as having the ability to be aethetically 
                designed, so I sought out to try and create my own imitation of the King of Spades. The thought pattern for the design of the king's face came from several iterations
                of a cartoon like portrayal of kings, noticing the hefty beards and majestic crowns. Using this backbone of information, I created the result you see now. This design
                remains to this date one of my favourite designs due to its simplicity and uniqueness.</p>

                Jeffrey was born. He's by no means a complex design, nor is he necessarily colourful, but to me he captures the essence of innocence and delicacy that comes to my imagination.
                I found that placing him within a simple thunderstorm environment would be able to express the very emotions described above.</p>
