        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Jason Less, and I am currently a third-year Computer Science student at UCLA. I was born and raised in the Bay Area, and attended Armijo High School, where I graduated as Valedictorian of my class. I like to maintain balance in my life between academics, athletics, and through various hobbies. I have played sports my entire life such as competitive division 1 soccer, baseball, basketball, tennis, and karate. I still enjoy playing soccer here at UCLA, where I have played on competitive intramural futsal and outdoor soccer teams. In terms of hobbies, I enjoy playing video games, the piano, solving various sized Rubix cubes (3x3 to 7x7), and maintaining and expanding my Nintendo video games collection.</p>
