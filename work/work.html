				<b> Description: </b> <br> <br>
				I am currently working with a team of UCLA faculty and students with the goal of building UCLA's first satellite. This is UCLA's first CubeSat Project, with the mission of studying the loss of relativistic electrons in Earth's radiation belt. ELFIN consists of several subsytems, and I am a member of the Command and Data Handling (CNDH) subsystem. My job is to write software for the satellite, and to develop specifically for ELFIN's Flight Computer (FC), Attitude Determination and Control Board (ACB), the ACB's Peripheral Controller (PC), and the Ground Software Equipment (GSE).
				<br> <br>
				As a member of the CNDH team, I have established a fully functional, bi-directional Universal Aysnchronous Receiver/Trasmitter (UART) serial connection between the ACB and the PC. In addition, I have implemented the majority of the PC's functionality, which takes place in its execution handler, and consists of reading and writing data to and from the PC to its memory map and the ACB (among other functions). Moreover, I have written software for one of the control laws for the ACB. The ACB works to constantly realign and maintain the spin plan of the satellite in response to Earth's magnetic fields to keep the satellite on its desired trajectory.

				<b> Period: </b> June 2017 <br>
				<b> Description: </b> <br> <br>
				For this project, I decided to recreate the classic arcade game, Space Invaders. For those not familiar with the game, the goal is for the player spaceship to destroy 55 alien spaceships by shooting them with lasers before they reach the bottom of the screen, while trying to avoid the alien lasers.

				>Here is a link to play the original game. 
				</a>
				<br> <br>
				This version is a simplified version of the game due to on-board memory constraint issues, and only having two weeks to work on the project. I noticed that as more objects were added to the game (i.e. more objects on the VGA display), the game began to act in an undefined manner (i.e. some alien objects stopped moving, or moved out of sync of the other alien objects, or the lasers began to glitch). I figured that this was due to FPGA board memory constraints (which is what the TA told me as well). I intend to complete the game using off-board memory and utilizing the MCB and MIG.

				<b> Period: </b> Feb. 2016 - March 2016 <br>
				<b> Description: </b> <br> <br>
				For one of my projects for CS 32 at UCLA, I was tasked with creating a 2D game similar to the arcade game "Dig Dug". The goal of the game is for the player (i.e. the fracker) to dig through the dirt to find all of the oil barrels for a given level, while either inflicting damage to the enemies (i.e. the protesters) or bribing them with gold.
				<br> <br>
				This game involved implementing a wide range of classes to create each of the in-game objects (i.e. player, protesters, gold, oil barrels, dirt, etc.). Through this project, I learned to use an in-game timing mechanism to get the objects to interact with other objects and to be displayed at appropriate intervals in the game.

				<b> Platform: </b> Intel Edison using the Grove Sensor Kit <br> 
				<b> Languages: </b> C <br>
				<b> Period: </b> May 2017 <br>
				<b> Description: </b> <br> <br>
				The goal of this project was to implement a simple IoT system using the Intel Edison (and various Grove Kit sensors) to unlock a door by sending a username/password string to a server, and receiving back authentication. Initially, the program was achieved using a single light sensor, which was used to encode a binary value to generate a 4-digit password. Moreover, the username was hardcoded into the program. This password was sent as plaintext to the server, and a plaintext response from the server (i.e. a YES or NO) was received by the Edison. Obviously, this simple implementation had serious security flaws such as the short password, and the unencrypted transmission of data to and from the server. This would make the client/server connection susceptible to a number of enemy attacks such as brute-force, dictionary, and rainbow attacks (for the weak password), and man-in-the-middle and replay attacks (due to the lack of encrypted data).
				<br> <br>
				A more secure implementation was developed to combat these security flaws. First of all, the password was increased to 8-digits, and instead of just having a binary value for each of the digits, each digit could have 8 possible values (ranging from 0-7). While still not as strong as it could be, this password length and characteristics served its purpose for this assignment. In addition, instead of a hard-coded username, a user of this IoT system could provide their own ID string. The strengthened password helped to protect against several of the attacks mentioned above, but other security measures were taken in the form of a timeout after a certain number of incorrect password attempts took place. After three failed attempts, the server would stop accepting messages from the Edison for a five minute period. This timeout would help to deter brute-force and dictionary attacks as an attacker couldn't just enter in an unlimited amount of attempts to crack the password. While the timeout helps in this regard, it is of importance to note that the actual method to input the password (i.e. the use of light sensors and a push button) would already serve to prevent the use of bots to perform the dictionary attacks for an attacker. Lastly, to prevent against man-in-the-middle and replay attacks, the program encrypted the data on the client (and server side) using the Open SSL APIs. In this way, the data would be encrypted going to the server and upon receiving the reply from the server, further strengthening the IoT system.
