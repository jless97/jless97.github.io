				My name is Jason Less, and I am currently a second-year Computer Science student at UCLA, minoring in Mathematics. I was born and raised in the Bay Area, and attended Armijo High School, where I graduated as Valedictorian of my class. I like to maintain balance in my life between academics, athletics, and through various hobbies. I have played sports my entire life such as competitive division 1 soccer, baseball, basketball, tennis, and karate. I still enjoy playing soccer here at UCLA, where I have played on competitive intramural futsal and outdoor soccer teams. In terms of hobbies, I enjoy playing video games, the piano, solving various sized Rubix cubes (3x3 to 7x7), and maintaining and expanding my Nintendo video games collection. 
				</p>

				I wasn't sure what I wanted to major in throughout high school, but knew that I wanted to pursue a career in the math or science-related fields. I decided to choose computer science, and couldn't be happier with my decision. Technology and computers are such powerful mediums for creating incredible ideas and products that can shape society for the better, and provide exciting means of entertainment and enjoyment to the masses. I am glad to be a part of this field, and hope to make my mark on technology in the future.
				</p>
				<p>
				There are so many facets of the computer science industry that I would like to explore. I have always had an interest and passion for video games, and would like to someday work on an exciting game for a respected company. I have played around with FPGAs, embedded systems, and virtual machines and have started to recreate some of the classic arcade games such as Space Invaders. Another interest of mine is in the aerospace industry, where I was fortunate to get to work with embedded system programming to write flight software for a satellite through the UCLA ELFIN project. I am interested in so much more, and hope to solidify what path I want to follow through my UCLA coursework, outside project, and future internships.
